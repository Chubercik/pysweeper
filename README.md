**Pysweeper** (onward stylized as `pysweeper` and pronounced `paɪˈswiːpə`) is a clone
of a classic single-player puzzle video game - [Minesweeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minesweeper_(video_game)),
written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).

There are binaries for Windows available thanks
to the [Nuitka](https://nuitka.net/) transpiler.

Linux binaries have been discontinued due to their large size,
but you can still download the source code and compile it yourself,
if for whatever reason you might feel like it.
